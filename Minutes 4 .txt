We searched the Internet for the introduction of various functions of various game platforms such as Steam, Origin, WeGame and Uplay, and collected information.
Wednesday
We started working on the Steam project page and introduced the games Steam recommended.
Thursday
We improved the Steam web page in our project and recommended the game.

We used hyperlink to link the data in the database steam.cshtml to the steam column of HOME and realized the page jump.

Sunday
We will search the Internet for information related to Origin, WeGame and Uplay platforms and use them all.
