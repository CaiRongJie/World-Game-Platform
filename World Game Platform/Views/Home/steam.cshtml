            What is SQuAD?
            Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

            New SQuAD2.0 combines the 100,000 questions in SQuAD1.1 with over 50,000 new, unanswerable questions written adversarially by crowdworkers to look similar to answerable ones. To do well on SQuAD2.0, systems must not only answer questions when possible, but also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering. SQuAD2.0 is a challenging natural language understanding task for existing models, and we release SQuAD2.0 to the community as the successor to SQuAD1.1. We are optimistic that this new dataset will encourage the development of reading comprehension systems that know what they don't know

            A Simple and Straight Game --"Superhot"            When testing reaction speed, tense and fast-paced first-person action and testing thinking, leisure and slow-paced turn strategy are two different types of games combined, that is, this SUPERHOT when you start to act, time will start to run.            You can think slowly about the next action, observe the surroundings, and use the elements. When you move, time is the normal flow, a fast-paced battle, and you are attacked once. Will die. A game, you can always act, play it as a test of reaction speed, a stimulating first-person action game; you can also think quietly before every move, consider the action after, with the most perfect way to kill every enemy.            Very interesting creativity, will be a perfect combination of fast and slow rhythm of the game with a full sense of attack, although the screen is very simple, but does not affect the fist to meat, bullet bursts and knife killing of the smooth not only pay attention to action oh, in fact, the plot is also very interesting after the clearance of the BGM listen well! Magic!            Creative full score, game mode is very interesting, can quickly fascinate people, but the content of the game is less, although you can try to use different ways to play, but the game will not be too long or tired, support developers, hope to launch a better game!            A word to sum up the game is: against the enemy and I will kill the non-rapid response simulation rapid response strategy first person action game... A word to sum up the feeling is: I am a good bull!            This time alone, creativity is worth seven points. This is really an innovative game worth supporting, and I'm looking forward to the sequel. 2.3 hours story mode customs clearance, this plot is the standard additions to the snake... After customs clearance, unlock the endless mode and challenge mode. Playfulness does not seem particularly high. It is estimated that within 30 hours, it depends on whether the official will add some content in the future.            Plus: The endless mode of the game is unexpectedly fun, which is the essence of the original ah! At first, the content of the endless mode is only to take a few steps in which direction, how to avoid the enemy's fire net, how to let the enemy hit his own people, how to attach himself to the enemy's rear. All these things need to be considered must be clearly in about three seconds, and then to solve a wave of more enemies than a wave, seize better weapons, and enter the next cycle.            After 40 kills, infinite mode has entered a strategy + action stage, because your weapons and time superpowers are not enough for your self-protection, always facing the choice of holding pistol or knife, terrain suitable for close combat or long-range shooting, battalion, gun calculation, the first person action shooting game can also play this step nobody. If the previous campaign and challenge mode can get 7 points, the endless mode can get at least 8.5 points.
